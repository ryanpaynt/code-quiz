# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Task

To make sure I have retained knowledge over the course of my boot camp so far I have cretaed this coding quiz. It is comprised of many components. HTML/CSS/JS files. This quiz is multiple choice and enables the user to answer them under the time limit. The game finishes when the time is done or if the questions are answered. At the end the user has a chance to make a mark and write their initials with their score.

## Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
